# Playwright JS Framework Test - Practice Repo

A modular and scalable UI test automation practice framework built using **Playwright (JavaScript)** with the following key concepts:
- Page Object Model (POM) – locators separated from actions  
- Actions layer – business workflows  
- Fixtures – dependency injection of common actions  
- Config + test data JSON – environment and user-data management  
- Reusable utilities (logger, etc.)
